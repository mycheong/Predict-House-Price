# Predict-House-Price project
This repository contains the work on building a Random Forest model and refining it for predicting house prices using data from the [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course). The work is coded in Python and involved pre-processing of the data, handling of missing values, encoding of categorical variables, feature selection, train a Random Forest model, tuning of model hyperparamters and refining feature selection. 

The jupyter notebook view of the work can be found here https://mycheong.github.io/Predict-House-Price/.
